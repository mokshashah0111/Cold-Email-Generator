# **Overview**

The Cold Email Generator is an AI-powered tool that helps job seekers craft personalized cold emails tailored to any job posting URL. It intelligently analyzes job descriptions, matches them with relevant portfolio projects stored in a vector database, and generates compelling cold emails to express interest in the role.

## üöÄ **How It Works**
1. **Input:** The user enters the URL of the job posting they‚Äôre interested in.
2. **Job Parsing:** Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.3-70B model processes the job URL to extract relevant details in structured JSON format.
3. **Portfolio Matching:** Based on the extracted job description, relevant portfolio links are retrieved from a ChromaDB vector database.   
4. **Email Generation:** The model then generates a personalized cold email, incorporating the matched portfolio links to highlight the user‚Äôs qualifications.

## üß† **Under the Hood**

**LLM-Powered Extraction:** Llama 3.3-70B (served via GROQ cloud) interprets and summarizes job descriptions.

**LangChain:** Used to orchestrate the LLM workflows and connect to the vector database.

**Vector Search:** Portfolio projects are stored in ChromaDB and retrieved based on semantic relevance to the job posting.

**Frontend:** A Streamlit interface provides a clean and intuitive user experience.
